# code
The code used to create my thesis, submitted to the Department of History in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts with Honors.

I uploaded all of my code before the departmental deadline to abide by the submission rules.
The main Jupyter Notebook was "Macro Exploring."

If you are here to repurpose the code (rather than grade it) feel free to look at the walkthrough files.
I've included one for each of my key computational techniques:
1. Expected Values
2. Territory Plots
3. Typological Classification/Grouping
4. Aesthetic Clustering (PCA & TSNE)
